# QCNN-FOR-MNIST-DATA-AND-MNIST-FASHION-DATA-
I was able to combine two different codes i.e. QCNN for MNIST Data and QCNN for MNIST FASHION Data into one single code. The results I got of the accuracy and loss comparison between Fully Connected Layer, Classical Convolutional Neural Networks and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks are really satisfying.

python==3.6.7  
tensorflow==2.1.0  
tesorflow-quantum==0.3.0  
keras==2.3.1  

These are the versions of tools that I used in this code.
