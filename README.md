# QCNN-FOR-MNIST-MNIST-FASHION-DATA-
I was able to combine two different codes i.e. QCNN for MNIST Data and QCNN for MNIST FASHION Data into one single code. The results I got of the accuracy and loss comparison between Fully Connected Layer, Classical Convolutional Neural Networks and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks are really satisfying.
